# üåå Realistic 3D Solar System Simulation

Welcome to the **Realistic 3D Solar System** project ‚Äî a fully interactive and educational simulation of our solar system. This version is a significant upgrade from the earlier project *solar-system3D*, with enhanced accuracy, improved visuals, and a host of new features.

Explore the solar system in both scientifically accurate and simplified modes, learn about each celestial body, and experience an immersive 3D journey through space.

## üìñ About

This project is a realistic and interactive 3D simulation of our solar system, created using Three.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore planets, view orbital movements, and access detailed information about each celestial body. Designed to be both educational and visually engaging, it's ideal for anyone interested in astronomy or 3D web development.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Accurate Visualization**: Realistic scaling of planets, orbits, and rotations based on actual astronomical data.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click on planets or the sun to access detailed information.
- **Dynamic Camera**: Smooth camera transitions that follow your selected celestial body.
- **Informative Details**: Learn about the size, composition, orbit, and fun facts for each planet and star.
- **Simulation Controls**: Adjust simulation speed, toggle between realistic/simplified modes, or pause the scene.
- **Orbit Rendering**: Visual display of planetary orbits with toggleable visibility.
- **Day/Night Effect**: Simulated lighting for planets with atmospheres.
- **Customizable UI**: Modify simulation settings using an intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: The primary engine powering the 3D graphics and animations, enabling lifelike rendering of the solar system.
- **JavaScript**: Drives the interactivity, logic, and animations within the simulation.
- **HTML5**: Provides the structural framework for embedding the 3D canvas on the web page.
- **CSS3**: Enhances the visual styling and responsiveness of the simulation layout.
- **[dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)**: Offers an easy-to-use graphical interface for users to modify simulation parameters in real-time.
